Below are a list of tasks that need to be done before Pharen is ready to be released (again).

1. PHP 5.4 support
    x Namely this involves getting rid of strict errors
        - Resolved for now by ignoring strict errors in php 5.4
    - Possible support for traits
2. More test coverage
    - Cover all lang.phn functions and macros
    x Cover new features
        x Namespaces
        x New lambdas
        x Lazy lists
        x Pharen Hashmaps
        x Pharen Vectors
    x Cover more edge cases
3. Clean up namespaces
    x Namespace all lib files
    ~ Formalize all namespace names and place under Pharen
        - Need to do one more check
    x Fix how funcvals are namespaced
    x Fix that you have to prepend global class names with a dot
        - Issue with PHP itself, not a big deal
4. Update documentation
    - Rewrite existing text to reflect changes
    - Document new features
    - Change the tutorial to use a better example
        - Talk about REPL-driven development
    - Document all the new lang functions
5. Fix mutability calls in multimethods
6. Flesh out PharenVector and PharenHashmap
    - Implement vectors as trees internally?
    - Add any necessary functions for working with hashmaps
        - update-in might be useful
7. Complete OOP support
    x Abstract classes and interfaces
        x Will allow for more compatibility with other PHP code
    - Class hints?
    - In general, still have to emphasize the functional nature of Pharen
