Below are a list of tasks that need to be done before Pharen is ready to be released (again).

1. PHP 5.4 support
    - Namely this involves getting rid of strict errors
    - Possible support for traits
2. More test coverage
    - Cover all lang.phn functions and macros
    - Cover new features (namespaces, new lambdas, etc.)
    - Cover more edge cases
3. Clean up namespaces
    - Namespace all lib files
    - Formalize all namespace names and place under Pharen
    - Fix how funcvals are namespaced
    - Fix that you have to prepend global class names with a dot
4. Update documentation
    - Rewrite existing text to reflect changes
    - Document new features
    - Change the tutorial to use a better example
        - Talk about REPL-driven development
    - Document all the new lang functions
5. Fix mutability calls in multimethods
6. Flesh out PharenVector and PharenHashmap
