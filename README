Pharen is compiler project that compiles a Lisp-inspired language to PHP.
The language is also called Pharen.

It is _very_ alpha and still under heavy development.

The first goal will be to create a language that more or less covers enough of PHP
to write basic apps.

The second goal will be for Pharen to be a good alternative to using straight PHP. The benefits
will be cleaner syntax and a way to abstract out annoyances in PHP.

The third goal will be to create abstractions for complicated features to be compiled to PHP.
At this point, I hope for Pharen to be more of a Lisp than just PHP with a lot of parentheses.
